 Software configuration: Default Settings, light theme
 Hardware specifications: Android smartphone with soft keyboard
 Network configuration: Any, not depended on network for this feature

[Steps to reproduce]
 1. Launch the Jobilis app
 2. Log in the user credentials
 3. Navigate to profile in the bottom navigation bar
 4. Click the `Post a Job` tab in the  `Job Post Management`
 5. Tap the `Title` input field
 6. Begin typing long text in the textbox
 7. Click submit and observe that input is accepted

[Actual results]
 The posted job displayed a too long title distorting the UI in a post

[Expected results]
 The title should display concise summary of the job description, not covering the description itself.

[Additional information]
 A screenshot of the affected interface has been attached for reference. No runtime logs were captured, as the QA team was provided only with an APK build. Additionally, the app is developed using Visual Studio with C# and MAUI, which requires specific configuration settings to enable logging or debug access.

Jobilis v1.0 1stPass UI [Feature]: Salary Field Input Validation Missing

[Summary]
 The expected salary input field allows users to enter excessively large numeric values (e.g., 999999999999), as there is no enforced input limit or validation. This may result in unrealistic job posts, UI distortion, and backend data issues.

[Precondition]
 Software version: Jobilis v1.o
 Software configuration: Default Settings, light theme
 Hardware specifications: Android smartphone
 Network configuration: Online/Offline scenarios tested

[Steps to reproduce]
 1. Launch the Jobilis app
 2. Log in the user credntials
 3. Navigate to profile in the bottom navigation bar
 4. Click the `Post a Job` tab in the  `Job Post Management`
 5. Locate the `Salary` input field.
 6. Enter an excessively large numeric value (e.g., 999999999999999).
 7. Review the posted data and UI rendering.

[Actual results]
 The app accepts the very large number without warning or restriction. The salary value appears unrealistic and affects data quality and UI formatting.

[Expected results]
 The app should restrict input to a reasonable numeric range (e.g., 1 to 1,000,000) and provide error or warning popup for extreme values to avoid large values.

[Additional information]
 A screenshot of the affected interface has been attached for reference. No runtime logs were captured, as the QA team was provided only with an APK build. Additionally, the app is developed using Visual Studio with C# and MAUI, which requires specific configuration settings to enable logging or debug access.

 6. Begin typing skills (e.g., `Java`)
 7. Observe the screen without scrolling manually

[Actual results]
 The dropdown containing skill suggestions is rendered behind the on-screen keyboard and is not visible until the user scrolls the screen manually.

 The dropdown should automatically adjust and become visible above the keyboard when typing, without requiring user-initiated scrolling.

 A screenshot of the affected interface has been attached for reference. No runtime logs were captured, as the QA team was provided only with an APK build. Additionally, the app is developed using Visual Studio with C# and MAUI, which requires specific configuration settings to enable logging or debug access.
